Requirements
The purpose of your portfolio is to help you get a job as a web developer.

Title: Hi, I'm Pete.

Include a bio: The main point of the site is to communicate who you are and what you're capable of. You'll need to have a short bio that focuses on your passions and interests, insofar as they pertain to your professional life as a developer.

    I am natural leader and developer who prides himself on diligence, collaboration, and delivering. I breath JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and SQL to make people's lives and work easier. I love being a father, a husband, crafting house projects, and learning. 

Project title - Random Gutenburg
Project description (keep it to one paragraph) - My first independent project while learning JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 solves the problem teachers and assessment writers face in finding non-copyrighted material to use when crafting English language arts high school assessments.  This simple website generates a random book(s), author, or topic from Project Gutenberg to potentially use as a text-based passage for assessing national learning standards.  It can also be used to find some new reading material from the public domain.  Enjoy Reading!

Contact info: At a minimum, you should include your email address, a link to your GitHub profile, and a link to your LinkedIn profile. Some students like to add a contact form. That's fine to do, but you should still include your email address.


Polished, Compelling Design and Feel: The overall look and feel should be neat, clean, and professional looking. We'll give you some tips on this later.

Responsive, mobile first: Will the hiring manager considering your application view your site on a phone or a desktop, or both? Who knows! So make sure your site is responsive and looks good on any screen size. Optimize for mobile first, and optionally progressively enhance for larger screens.

Titles, short descriptions, links, and screenshots: For each app you showcase, you should include the app name, a link to the live app and repo, a short description, and a compelling screenshot.

Only code from scratch projects: Apps like fizzbuzz and the shopping list do not belong in your portfolio. To begin with, you can add your quiz app from the previous module. Later in the program, you'll create at least 3 capstone projects, which you should include in your portfolio.

No CSS frameworks or templates: It can be tempting to use tools like Bootstrap and Materialize to achieve the look you want for your portfolio, but that's not what most employers want to see. This site is your first chance to demonstrate your skills as a web developer. A site styled with vanilla CSS will stand out far more.

No errors in the console: Hiring managers usually have a ton of applicants, which means they're initially looking for quick reasons to dismiss you. If they open up DevTools on your portfolio site and see errors, that may be enough to pass you over. So make sure your final site doesn't have any errors.

Reasonable load time: We'll discuss how to achieve this later, but the page should load quickly (i.e., 2 seconds or less).
